## Solution 1: HashSet + TwoSum

This solution can solve the problem using just one for-loop. During the iteration, we can perform a two-sum operation from index i to the last index. We use a hash set to keep track of the two-sum results to avoid duplication.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) since we call the two-sum function n times. It also has a space complexity of O(n) because we only use one hash set.

Java

```java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> threeSum(int[] nums) {
      	// Sort given array for two-sum
	Arrays.sort(nums);
        List<List<Integer>> ans = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length && nums[i] <= 0; i++) { // Stop when nums[i] > 0, since 3-sum = 0 is impossible
            if (i == 0 || nums[i] != nums[i - 1]) {// Two-Sum part, pass if current element is the same as the one before
              	// Use a hashset to make the answer unique
		HashSet<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
                for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                    if (seen.contains(-(nums[i] + nums[j]))) {// Check if -(nums[i] + nums[j]) exists
                        ans.add(Arrays.asList(nums[i], nums[j], -(nums[i] + nums[j])));
			//if current j is the same as the next element, pass it
                        while (j + 1 < nums.length && nums[j] == nums[j + 1]) j++;
                    }
                    seen.add(nums[j]);
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}

	nums.sort()
        ans = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > 0: # Stop when nums[i] > 0, since 3-sum = 0 is impossible
                break
            if i == 0 or nums[i] != nums[i - 1]: # Two-Sum part, pass if current element is the same as the one before
                seen = set()
                j = i + 1
                while j < len(nums): # Since iterator won't react to adjustion to index j, so it's better to use a while loop here
                    if -(nums[i] + nums[j]) in seen: # Check if -(nums[i] + nums[j]) exists
                        ans.append([nums[i],nums[j], -(nums[i] + nums[j])])
                      	# Pass if current element j is same to nums[j+1]
			while j + 1 < len(nums) and nums[j] == nums[j+1]:
                            j += 1
                    seen.add(nums[j])
                    j += 1
  
        return ans

## Solution 2: Two-pointer

This solution aims to find unique triplets within a list that add up to zero. It begins by sorting the list, which is essential for efficiency. The code then uses two pointers, y and z, to represent the second and third values in a potential triplet. It employs a nested loop to check for triplets, avoiding duplicates by skipping over identical values. Whenever a valid triplet summing to zero is found, it is appended to the ans list. The code efficiently handles both duplicates and adjusts the pointers based on whether the current sum is less than or greater than zero. Once all possible triplets for a given x have been explored, the loop moves on to the next x. Finally, the function returns a list of unique triplets that meet the criteria, making this a concise and effective solution for the problem.

Python

```python
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        ans = []
        nums.sort() # Sort the numbers
  
        # Traverse the list and search for unique triplets (x, y, z) that sum to 0
        for x in range(len(nums) - 2):
            # Skip duplicates
            if x > 0 and nums[x] == nums[x - 1]:
                continue

            # Initialize indices for the 2nd and 3rd value
            y = x + 1
            z = len(nums) - 1

            # Traverse the list, starting from y and calculate the sum of the triplets
            while y < z:
                sum = nums[x] + nums[y] + nums[z]

                # If the sum is 0, add the triplet to the list of answers and skip duplicates
                if sum == 0:
                    ans.append([nums[x], nums[y], nums[z]])

                    while y < z and nums[y] == nums[y + 1]:
                        y += 1
                    while y < z and nums[z] == nums[z - 1]:
                        z -= 1

                    y += 1
                    z -= 1
                elif sum < 0:
                    y += 1  # Sum is too small, increment second index
                else:
                    z -= 1  # Sum is too large, decrement third index
  
        return ans
